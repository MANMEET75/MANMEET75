<h3>Honesty Predictor</h3>
<p>Application = I Made this machine learning model for the convenience of HR managers while taking interviews now the question arises how? if the salary predicted by our machine learning model is around the salary told by the applicant according to the previous company then it means that person is honest if there is a huge variation in the actual and the predicted salary then we will conclude that the applicant is not honest and it does not mean he or she is not familiar with skills it only means we will not give any money related responsibility to that particular applicant in the company </p>
<p>Note:- I have collected the dataset for this Model from salaryexplorer.com which to be very honest may be correct or may not be correct we can take this model as a sample model and in future if I will have a real dataset of different companies then I can work on this model for tons of Observations.Over here After data collection, I have used Data Preprocessing techniques such as feature engineering then I have used Random Forest Regression for prediction salary which is continuous numerical values</p>

<h3>Meta Stock Price Predictor</h3>
<p>Application = We can use this deep learning model to predict the trends in the stock market which might be very profitable but as we all know that we cannot predict the accurate stock prices because if we can do so then we would all become billionaires. we can see the upward and downward trends over here using this model   </p>
<p>Note:- For this Model, I have collected 10 years of the dataset from yahoofinance.com then After using all the data preprocessing techniques. I have built and trained Recurrent Neural Network using Keras I have added LSTM layers (Long Short Term Memory).  I collected the dataset till JUN 22 then I  predicted the trend for the Whole month of JULY 22 and as you can see in the repository I got an almost similar pattern.</p>
